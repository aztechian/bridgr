# Bridgr Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

The security of Bridgr is a top priority for the project, and we understand that it will be critical for our users given the purpose of Bridgr. We are committed to keeping information safe and secure and providing a safe tool for our users to rely upon. We welcome the contribution of any external security researchers.

## How to Submit a Report

To submit a vulnerability report, please contact us at bridgr@imartin.io. Your submission will be reviewed and validated by a maintainer.

- Do not submit a normal issue or pull request in our public repository, instead report through our Bug Bounty or directly to security@jet.com (If you would like to encrypt, please contact us for keys)
- We will review your submission and may follow up for additional details
- If you have a patch, we will review it and approve it privately; once approved for release you can submit it as a pull request publicly in our repos (we give credit where credit is due)
- We will keep you informed during our investigation, feel free to check in for a status update
- We will release the fix and publicly disclose the issue as soon as possible, but want to ensure we due properly due diligence before releasing
- Please do not publicly blog or post about the security issue until after we have updated the public repo so that other downstream users have an opportunity to patch

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder. If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local information.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party.

We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third party against you. Researchers are still responsible for their access to third party websites and files, and Bridgr cannot provide safe harbor assurances for accessing third party resources when using Bridgr.

Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences

- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact.
- Include the version number of the vulnerable package in your report
- Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
